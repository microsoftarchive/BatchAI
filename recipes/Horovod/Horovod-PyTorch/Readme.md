# Horovod

This recipe shows how to run [Horovod](https://github.com/uber/horovod) distributed training framework for PyTorch using Batch AI.


## Details

- Standard Horovod [pytorch_mnist.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber/horovod/master/examples/pytorch_mnist.py) example will be used;
- pytorch_mnist.py downloads training data on its own during execution;
- The job will be run on standard PyTorch container batchaitraining/pytorch:0.4.0-cp36-cuda9-cudnn7;
- Horovod framework will be installed in the container using job preparation command line. Note, you can build your own docker image containing PyTorch and horovod instead.
- Standard output of the job will be stored on Azure File Share.
